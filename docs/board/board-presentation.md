# Short Call Web
## Board of Management Briefing

Modern short-call governance and staffing agility for BC Place operations.

---

## Why this matters now

- Demand volatility by shift is increasing.
- Manual short-call coordination is slow and opaque.
- Governance consistency is required across departments.

**Need:** faster allocation + fair process + executive visibility.

---

## Current pain points

- Delayed publishing and candidate mobilization.
- Limited visibility of who applied first.
- Inconsistent decision controls by team.
- Difficult management-level reporting.

---

## Proposed operating workflow

1. Manager/Admin creates short-call request.
2. Schedule reviews frequency and approves/rejects.
3. Employees apply to approved calls.
4. Queue is ordered by timestamp.
5. Status is visible: pending, confirmed, waitlisted.

---

## Governance model

- **Employee:** apply + track status.
- **Manager:** submit requests + monitor ranking.
- **Schedule:** approval gate and balancing authority.
- **Admin:** complete oversight and policy control.
