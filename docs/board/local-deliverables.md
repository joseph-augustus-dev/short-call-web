# Local Board Deliverables (No GitHub dependency)

These files are prepared to be used **locally** and presented immediately:

- `docs/board/management-proposal.html` (board proposal document; print to PDF from browser)
- `docs/board/board-presentation.html` (board presentation deck; full-screen slide mode)
- `docs/board/management-proposal.md` (editable source proposal)
- `docs/board/board-presentation.md` (editable source slides)

## How to use locally

1. Run a local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

2. Open in browser:

- `http://localhost:4173/docs/board/management-proposal.html`
- `http://localhost:4173/docs/board/board-presentation.html`

3. Export PDF directly from browser Print (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`).

## Why this format

- Works immediately in your local machine.
- No extra dependency required.
- Easy to revise before final board meeting.
